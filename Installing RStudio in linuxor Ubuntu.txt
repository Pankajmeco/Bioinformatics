#Installing R Studio in ubuntu. Ubuntu works faster with RStudio and requires comparatively limited computational power. 

Step 1: Open terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) in Ubuntu
Step 2: Update the packageâ€™s cache. using the following code in the terminal (-s) is being used to bypass the requirement of access to root if you are using virtualmachine like me

sudo -s apt-get update

Step 3: Install R environment

sudo -s apt -y install r-base

Check for the version of R package using

R --version

Step 4: Check R installation by using the following command.

user@Ubuntu:~$ R 

(Need to have R version post 3.6+ for proper functions and packages)




##Install Rstudio on Ubuntu  : We use .deb type of installer which is like .exe file but for linux but you cannot simply download and install it 

Step 5: Install gdebi package to install .deb packages easily.

sudo -s add-apt-repository universe

sudo -s apt-get install gdebi-core

Step 6: Go to R Studio downloads and select the latest *.deb package available under Ubuntu 18/Debian 10.

Step 7: Navigate to the Downloads folder in the local machine.

in terminal type the following

$ cd Downloads/
$ ls

you should find something like this "rstudio-1.2.5042-amd64.deb"

Step 8: Install using gdebi package.

sudo gdebi rstudio-1.2.5042-amd64.deb

Step 9: Run the RStudio using Terminal

user@Ubuntu:~/Downloads/ $ rstudio 

If R Studio opens properly , well done!! pat yourself!!

Now you can use RStudio in Ubuntu which will be atleast three times faster than RStudio in windows
